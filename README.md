# Sysadmin-Tasks

This project was created as part of my cybersecurity bootcamp. It demonstrates key Windows system administration tasks, including configuring Group Policy Objects (GPOs), automating tasks with PowerShell scripting, and implementing best practices for managing a secure Active Directory (AD) environment.

## Project Overview

System administration is a crucial part of managing enterprise networks. In this project, I:
- Automated various administrative tasks using **PowerShell scripts**.
- Configured Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings and user permissions.
- Conducted routine sysadmin tasks, such as creating and managing users, groups, and organizational units (OUs) in Active Directory.
- Troubleshot and resolved common system issues.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 (Nested virtual machine)
- **Scripts**: PowerShell
- **Active Directory Tools**: Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- **Virtualization**: Lab environment provided by the bootcamp
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Scripting, troubleshooting, configuration, and system hardening

## Key Features

1. **PowerShell Scripting**
   - Automating user and group creation.
   - Bulk management of Active Directory accounts.
   - Generating system audit logs for compliance and security.

2. **Group Policy Configuration**
   - Enforcing password complexity and expiration policies.
   - Managing user access to network resources.
   - Restricting software installation via GPOs.

3. **Administrative Tasks**
   - Managing Organizational Units (OUs) to structure the AD environment.
   - Resetting user passwords and unlocking accounts.
   - Diagnosing and resolving issues using built-in Windows tools.

## How to Replicate This Project

To replicate this project, follow these steps:
1. Set up a nested Windows virtual machine for testing purposes.
2. Configure Active Directory with a domain environment using Windows Server.
3. Use the included PowerShell scripts to automate administrative tasks.
4. Apply the provided GPO templates to enforce security policies.
5. Test and troubleshoot common scenarios, such as user account lockouts or GPO application failures.


## Screenshots
Below are some screenshots from the project (examples):

Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): Applied GPO settings.
Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC): User and group management.
PowerShell Outputs: Script execution logs.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in managing and securing a Windows domain environment. By automating administrative tasks and implementing security best practices, I gained valuable skills in system administration, troubleshooting, and scripting.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to my instructors and peers at the bootcamp for their guidance and support during this project.
